// How Input of Task Details will work
- Clicking the add button will create an overlay, that will allow you to input some details for your task
- Input boxes pop up in the assigned places on the overlay, a submit button or add button will call the createTask() function
- There will be a button at the bottom that will include the option to add a subtask
- More input boxes will pop under the main task section, with a smaller font, that will allow you to enter the details of the subtask.


Object Creation:


// How The Tasks will be Handled

- Create two classes in the HTML file: Completed and Incomplete.
- All tasks start in the Incomplete Class.
- When completed or checked out, remove the task from the 'Incomplete' Class, and add it to the 'Complete' Class.
- If the user decides to unchech a task, remove it from the 'Complete' Class and add it back to the 'Incomplete' Class.

- Need to create a Task Manager for that will handle the mechanics of these tasks
