//Pseudocode for Navigation Bar

var current_page;

// Will need to create some logic to determine which page the user is currently on
// Assume that we are on the home (Dashboard) page

current_page = "Home";

// Let's assume that the navigation is some buttons arranged in a rectangle grid such: HOME... TASKS... MODULES

<button onclick="navigationFucntion(current_page, HOME)"> HOME </button>	// This will be done when user wants to visit HOME page
<button onclick="navigationFucntion(current_page, TASKS)"> TASKS </button>	// This will be done when user wants to visit the TASKS page
<button onclick="navigationFucntion(current_page, MODULES)"> MODULES </button>	// This will be done when user wants to visit the MODULES page



<script>
function navigationFunction(string current_page, string target_page) {
	// First hide all the other pages (that is, div's)
	- change display property of the HOME page [for class = Home {display: none}]
	- change display property of the TASKS page [for class = Tasks {display: none}]
	- change display property of the MODULES page [for class = Modules {display: none}]

	// Unhide the desired page
	- change the display property of the HOME page [for class = Home {display: }]
}
</script>



//***************THOUGHTS:**************//
- Perhaps I will need to change the HTML in the style tags
