<h1> STUDENT PLANNER - COMP1004 Project (UoP) </h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Project Vision: What is it?</h3>
The student planner can simply be described as a To-Do list with additional features. These additional features include a Module page where you can list down your module information. As the name and features suggest, the target audience for this app is students.

The student planner has a To-Do list design that is simple, a must for most applications. No one really wants a complicated application, otherwise, there is no need for it. Students are able to add their tasks for the day, or any other tasks, and they will be listed on the tasks page. Everytime that a student completes a task, they can click it off the list and then it is stored in the completed tasks list at the very top of the task list. Should the user decide that they didn't really complete the task, they are able to add it back to the pending tasks list by simply unchecking it.

In addition to the To-Do list, there is a module page where students can keep track of the key information on their modules. At the University of Plymouth, students use the Moodle services, or simple DLE. Here, students can review everything they need to know about their module. The difference with this application and the DLE, is that the module page is directly a part of the application. So there is less movement between different windows to make the changes or note down the information that you need when adding your tasks to the page. 

The modules page has a very simple design, inspired by the UCAS platform. Each module is presented in cards that are about a third of the page, with information like Module name, how many assignments you have left, the days that you regularly have lectures (this feature may not be so useful for students who have modules that change dates or the dates for their modules are not consistent). For more information about the module, users can click the 'view more' option on the cards. This displays your module in even more detail, presenting the assignments with their titles, the due date and the contributions that they have towards your final grade for that module. You may also see exam details, should you add details about your exam, on the expanded module page.


<h4>Why I chose this as my project?</h4>
Honestly, this started out as banking application, and then I realised that I severely underestimated the requirements and skill needed for this, as well as overestimate my will to go through all the documentation and pages that outline the security requirements for such an application. So I ended up doing a student planner. The idea of a student planner came from my struggle to plan in my new environment in University. So I looked for different ways of planning my day out and arranging information so that I can keep track of all this information. I then decided to get the opinion of my friends on how they are managing their University life. They too confirmed the struggles of planning and keeping all the information in one place. Hence, I sought to create an application that handles this. While this may not address all the issues of planning, students still need to be prudent and carry out other procedures before committing to their plans, having a student planner that stores most of your information the required things for university is still a good start.



<h4>How did I do it?</h4>
For this project, we were only permitted to use the following tools:

`HTML`
`CSS`
`JavaScript`

This being my first time using the above tools, meant that I first had to deal with a learning curve. All the resources that I used to learn how to use these tools are listed at the very bottom of this `README.md` document. It was a stressful beginning, as I did not know much about the tools, but just applying them for different cases was useful and the help of the online resources made it even easier.

It should be noted that I also had assistance from many of my colleagues at the University at the PALs session and the Sprint Review Meetings that we had every 2 weeks. However, this was only for guidance and ensuring that I stay within the limits of the project and don't go overboard by using features that are outside the scope of my level.
