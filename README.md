<h1> STUDENT PLANNER - COMP1004 Project (UoP) </h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>Project Vision: What is it?</h2>

The student planner can simply be described as a To-Do list with additional features. These additional features include a Module page where you can list down your module information. As the name and features suggest, the target audience for this app is students.

The To-Do list is simple. Students are able to add tasks, and then list them on the tasks page. Everytime that a student completes a task, they can click it off the list and then it is stored in the completed tasks list that can be found at the very top of the task list. Should the user realise that they didn't really complete the task, or they just want to add it back to the uncompleted task, they can do this by simply unchecking it.

Then there is the module page where students can keep track of the key information on their modules. At the University of Plymouth, students use the Moodle services, or simply DLE. Here, students can review everything they need to know about their module. The difference with this application and the DLE, is that the module page is directly a part of the application. So there is less movement between different windows to make the changes or note down the information that you need when adding your tasks to the page. 

The modules page has a very simple design, inspired by the UCAS platform. Each module is presented in cards that are about a third of the page, with information about the module. To view this information in more detail, users can click the 'view more' option on the cards. This expands the module and provides more details about the contents of the module like assignment deadlines, exam dates, and their contribution to the overal module mark.

However, you do not have to go through the modules page and expand the card every time you wish to view the assignment details. For this, you can click on the assignment page in the navigation bar. From there, any of the assignments that you added can be viewed on the assignments page. It is also possible to add the assignments, and edit them through this page. I believe this makes it easier to manage your assignment information, because it removes the hustle of navigating through the modules Page.


<h3><ins>Why I chose this as my project?</ins></h3>
Learning how to do something requires challenging obstacles. Based on my experience, that is, no experience in the tools used until now, a student planner was a great pick for me. It provided both a challenge, as well as a chance to make something that can be useful in the real world. Being someone who likes to be organised, lead me to selecting this project. I ask some of my friends across different universities outside of the UK, and then pointed out that one of the challenges they face is having an application that helps them keep their student life organised. They have to use multiple apps to get it organised. So why not create one app, that aims to handle all of this. 

While my application is not meant to fully replace the other fully established apps used across the world in the productivity cactegory, it is starting point. So I can say I am proud of what I came up with.


<h3><ins>How did I do it?</ins></h3>
For this project, we were only permitted to use the following tools:

`HTML`
`CSS`
`JavaScript`

This being my first time using the above tools, meant that I first had to deal with a learning curve. All the resources that I used to learn how to use these tools are listed at the very bottom of this `README.md` document. It was a stressful beginning, as I did not know much about the tools, but just applying them for different cases was useful and the help of the online resources made it even easier.

It should be noted that I also had assistance from many of my colleagues at the University at the PALs session and the Sprint Review Meetings that we had every 2 weeks. However, this was only for guidance and ensuring that I stay within the limits of the project and don't go overboard by using features that are outside the scope of my level.

For any successful project, there is need for good planning. I made use of the Agile Software Development Methodology. This concept was introduced to us by the University, and was the methodology outlined in our Coursework Description. **It was a requirement!** Within 2 weeks, the developers are meant to get some feedback on their progress and then moving on to the next part. However, before all this, there is need for requirements analysis, where the developers were to identify what are the main requirements for this project. This was so that we don't get lost in the development process, and instead, make sure that meet the requirements first. If I decided to add any other features to the application, this would be done after I am confident that I have met all other prior requirements.


<h3><ins>What were the requirements of the project?</ins></h3>
I will keep it short...

1. You should be able to add a task.
2. You should be able to check off a task from the list when it is complete.
3. You should be able to edit or delete that task.
4. You should be able to add a module.
5. You should be able to edit the contents of that module or delete the module and its associated contents.
6. This information should be stored somewhere, and be loaded everytime the user starts or opens the web application.
